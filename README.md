# Diminish

Diminish attaches icons to unit frames or nameplates, displaying time left until a [diminishing returns](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Diminishing_returns) category expires for that unit, as well as how far the category is diminished. *(Green border = 50% duration, yellow = 25%, red = 0%)* You can filter which categories/unitframes to track for and more.
