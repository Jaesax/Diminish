# Diminish

Diminish attaches icons to unit frames or nameplates, displaying time left until a [diminishing returns](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Diminishing_returns) category expires for that unit. As well as how far the category is diminished. *(Green border = 50% duration, yellow = 25%, red = 0%)*
  
Diminish can track DRs on both mobs and players if you enable PvE mode in the options.

**Note:** Diminish is now in maintenance mode so new features won't be added other than bug fixes.

## Configuration

Type `/diminish` to open the options panel. You may also skin the icons using [Masque](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque).

DR icons for each unit frame is separately configurable. **Certain unit frames are default disabled for tracking or only enabled for certain zones.**

You can manually set icons used for a DR category by right clicking one of the checkboxes under "Enabled Categories" section.

## Notes
- Diminish not working with an unitframe addon? Go to options and enable "Anchor to UIParent", then position the icons wherever you want. For Party frames, try disabling "Use Raid-Style Party Frames" under WoW's interface options.
- Supports tracking max 5 party/raid frames.
- The addon is now in maintenance mode. New DRs & bugs will still be fixed, but new features won't be added.
