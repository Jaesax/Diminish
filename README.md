# Diminish (Battle for Azeroth 8.0.0+)
Lightweight diminishing returns tracker for both friendly and enemy players.
Diminish attaches icons to unit frames, displaying time left until a diminishing returns category expires,
as well as how far the category is diminished.

Icons for each unit frame is separately configurable. Type **/diminish** to open the options panel.
Default config is set to only use enemy target/focus frame tracking outside arena, and only arena frame tracking while inside arena.
